# IPonCC
Shows all sorts of IP addresses for the device in the iOS Control Center. Cellular, WiFi and VPN, both IPv4 and IPv6.
The toggle doesn't toggle anything, 3D-pressing it shows the info. It updates the info each time the toggle is 3D-touched, not live.

In order to compile this, one needs the headers and Frameworks dirs from [SiloToggleModule example](https://github.com/ioscreatix/SiloToggleModule) by [ioscreatix](https://github.com/ioscreatix), and theos of course.

The compiled .deb is 64-bit only. iOS >= 11.
